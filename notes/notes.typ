- 1 (yellow): TCLK
  - doesn't appear to change when pen is presented (It is assumed that this pin isn't doing anything during recieve cycle, but not checked, cause probing is hard)
- 2 (green): X (Common line of the multiplexers)
  - doesn't appear to change during transmission cycle when pen is presented

I think the different amplitudes are the processor probing through the matrix.

Data from the included pen, doesn't look very clear, might be because I partially ruined the pen, and it isn't exactly at a nice angle

Data from an incompatible pen, from a different wacom tablet
