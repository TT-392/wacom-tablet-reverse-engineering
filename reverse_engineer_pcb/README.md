# wacom-tablet-reverse-engineering
An attempt at reverse engineering a wacom one small drawing tablet, with as goal to eventually build a wacom compatible framework 16 drawing tablet module.


Sorry for the unwieldly pcb file, kicad stores images as text in their file format, and this one has rather high resulution scans of the tablet.
